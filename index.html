            <p class = "p1-sec">Hey everyone! My name is Justin Finn and I am a Computer Science Major at The University of Tennessee at Martin. Besides Computer Science, I am minoring in Cybersecurity and Spanish. While I am not in class, I am also the President of UTM's Associative Computing Machinery club for the Computer Science department. Also, I was given the amazing opportunity of working at UTM's STEM Lab as a Computer Science and Mathematical tutor.</p>

            <p class = "p2-sec">From a young age, Iâ€™ve been captivated by the endless possibilities of technology. My creativity thrives in this world, where innovation meets problem-solving, and I find joy in bringing ideas to life through coding, design, and invention. Technology has always been my canvas, allowing me to express myself and shape solutions in unique and meaningful ways.</p>

            <p class = "p3-sec">As of right now, I am looking for more ways to enhance my skillset and find more opportunities to put them to good use.
